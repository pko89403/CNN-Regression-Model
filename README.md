# CNN-Regression-Model
This is the CNN prediction model using tensorflow. maybe using keras? i think keras is easy to code( I don't decide it yet. '18.08.29' )
Well i find that regression model with CNN is not that hard. just change the last convolutional layer to the linear layer.(not using relu)
I think that is same as making SVM prediction model. I already know the code of the CNN regression model(link is https://github.com/MyungjaeSong/Paired-Library)
